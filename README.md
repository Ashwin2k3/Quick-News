Yes, you can definitely create a website similar to Inshorts using Django and a public news API. Here's an outline of how you can approach this:

### Key Steps:

1. **Set Up Django Project**:
   - Create a Django project and define the required models for storing news articles if you want to save them.
   - You might need models for categories (Technology, Politics, Geopolitics, etc.).

2. **News API Integration**:
   - Use a public news API like NewsAPI to fetch news articles. 
   - You can filter articles by category when fetching, or store articles in your database and categorize them.
   - Example categories could include technology, politics, sports, business, entertainment, and geopolitics.

3. **Fetching and Filtering News**:
   - Write a function in Django to fetch articles from the NewsAPI, filtering them by category.
   - You can create different views and URLs to display filtered news in sections.
   - Implement pagination for easy browsing.

4. **Django Models**:
   - **News Article Model**: Store title, description, published date, and URL.
   - **Category Model**: Manage categories like Technology, Politics, etc.
   
5. **Views and Templates**:
   - Create views to list news articles by category.
   - Templates can be styled similar to Inshorts, with a card-based UI for news articles.
   - Add sections for filtering based on category, such as Technology, Politics, etc.

6. **Search Functionality**:
   - Allow users to search for specific news articles.

7. **Scheduling News Fetching**:
   - Use Django's `Celery` or `django-cron` to schedule regular fetching of news articles in the background.

8. **Design and Styling**:
   - Use Bootstrap or Bootswatch to style your site and make it mobile-friendly.

### Example Tech Stack:
- **Backend**: Django with NewsAPI integration.
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap for mobile-friendly design, with filtering sections similar to Inshorts.
- **API**: Public news APIs like NewsAPI.
